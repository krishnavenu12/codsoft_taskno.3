# 🖼️ Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as a decoder to generate captions for input images.

## 🧠 Features

- Image preprocessing with InceptionV3
- Tokenization and sequence padding
- LSTM decoder with attention (optional)
- Streamlit interface to upload and caption images

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- Numpy, Pillow

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
streamlit run image_captioning.py
